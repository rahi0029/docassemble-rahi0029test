  **PLEASE NOTE:** UCWB financial counsellors cannot provide you with advice as to what financial options will suit you best. Please see a financial adviser to discuss such matters.
  
  UCWB counsellors can assist you to plan a way out of your debt. For example, they can talk to debt collectors on your behalf to resolve debt issues. They can also guide you in understanding what other financial options are available to you. 
  
  UCWB can also not provide you with any legal advice.
